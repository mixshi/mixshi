# Howdy Howdy Howdy

- I'm currently learning OpenGL in C++ so as to eventually make a game engine, or just learn more about the game development process.

- My favorite language is Java, though I am aware of it's setbacks, it was my first language and it always just eases my mind to lean back on that good old OOP syntax.

  ~~Hopefully my C++ isn't as OOP as my Java ;)~~

- I am an avid hater of javascript and python ðŸ˜› they're too much of a crutch for people to lean on to avoid doing actual development.

- Elsewhere, I'm trying to get a Private Pilot's License, I play pickleball at my local Recreation Centre, write poetry, and I also enjoy drawing silly little kitty cats <3
